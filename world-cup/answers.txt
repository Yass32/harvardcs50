Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 10 &nd 100 proved to be incorrect simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000
After 1000 simulations the outcome has been the same; therefore I believe simulations would give
"good enough" prediction
